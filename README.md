## Why choose clock-rs?

Why use clock-rs over tty-clock?

clock-rs ...
- ... uses a configuration file for managing its settings, alongside with the ability to overwrite them through the command line,
- ... is built in Rust, allowing for safety as well as quick development,
- ... and will receive more updates in the future!

## Installation

### Dependencies

To install clock-rs from source, ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) along with Cargo installed.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository

    `$ git clone https://github.com/Oughie/clock-rs`

2. Navigate into the new directory

    `$ cd clock-rs`

3. Build the project using Cargo

    `$ cargo build --release`

After the build is complete, you can find the executable in the `target/release/` directory.  
Optionally, you can make the file globally executable.

On Linux, run the following commands:  

```
$ sudo cp target/release/clock-rs /usr/local/bin/
$ chmod +x target/release/clock-rs
```

You can then run the executable via the `clock-rs` command.

## Usage

```
Usage: clock-rs [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -c, --color <COLOR>        Specify the clock color [possible values: white, black, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan]
  -x, --x-pos <X_POS>        Set the position along the horizontal axis [possible values: start, center, end]
  -y, --y-pos <Y_POS>        Set the position along the vertical axis [possible values: start, center, end]
      --fmt <FMT>            Use a custom date format, e.g. "%A, %B %dth %Y"
  -t                         Use the 12h format
  -i, --interval <INTERVAL>  Set the poll interval in milliseconds
  -h, --help                 Print help
  -V, --version              Print version
```

## Configuration

clock-rs uses the [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) file format for its settings.  
By default, the configuration file is named `conf.toml` and is stored in the OS configuration directory, within the `clock-rs` subdirectory .

On Linux: `~/.config/clock-rs/conf.toml`

This path can be changed using the environment variable `CONF_PATH`.  
Any argument passed in the command line will overwrite these settings.

### Example

Here's an example `conf.toml` file setup:

```toml
[general]
# Specify the color of the clock (= "white")
# Possible values are: white, black, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan)
color = "magenta"
# Set the poll intervall in milliseconds (= 1000)
interval = 999

[position]
# Specify the position along the horizontal and vertical axis (= "center")
# Possible values are: start, center, end
horizontal = "start"
vertical = "end"

[date]
# Set a custom date format (= "%d-%M-%Y")
fmt = "%A, %B %dth %Y"
# Specify, whether to use the 12 hour format (= false)
use_12h = true
```
